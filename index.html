		                    I maintain that the correct answer is No. I argue that the prosecutor's burden of proof does not only consist in establishing the high probability of the defendant's guilt; it also consists in (1) establishing guilt with a resiliently high probability, and in (2) offerring a reasonably specific and detailed narrative of the crime. My account has applications to debates in epistemology  about lottery propositions, and to questions in legal scholarship regarding the use of statistical evidence in criminal trials. </p>

My working hypothesis is that a considerable portion of legal knowledge and reasoning is contained in legislative texts (laws, decrees, regulations, directives, etc.). So my primary task will be to formalize a piece of legislation in the language of the Event Calculus.</p>

		                  <p class="description">  Talks of incommensurable conceptual schemes typically allude to the following picture: there is reality that is inaccessible per se, on the one hand, and there is us, or different groups of people, accessing reality by means of incommensurable conceptual schemes, on the other. But what does it mean for two schemes to be incommensurable? And is incommensurability at all intelligible to us?   Donald Davidson famously argued that incommensurability is unintelligible. His argument first provides a definition of incommensurability, and then shows that incommensurability thus defined is unintelligible. I will argue, contra Davidson, that his definition of incommensurability does not lend any support to the unintelligibility claim.</p>

		                    <p class="description">In this paper we describe a legal core ontology that is part of the <em>Legal Knowledge Interchange Format</em>: a knowledge representation formalism that enables the translation of legal knowledge bases written in different representation formats and formalisms. A legal (core) ontology can play an important role in the translation of existing legal knowledge bases to other representation formats, in particular as the basis for articulate knowledge serving. This requires that the ontology has a firm grounding in commonsense and is developed in a principled manner. We describe the theory and methodology underlying the LKIF core ontology, compare it with other ontologies, introduce the concepts it defines, and discuss its use in the formalisation of an EU directive. </p>

		                <div class="collapsible-description-div content-panel" style="display:none">
		                  <p class="description">Lottery propositions are well-known to epistemologists. Their peculiarity is that we don’t think we are in a position to know them, despite their high probability. Hawthorne in Knowledge and Lotteries (2004) formulated the following puzzle: (a) we do not think we are in a position to know lottery propositions; (b) we can deduce lottery propositions from other propositions which we think we are in a position to know; (c) so, if knowledge claims are closed under deduction, as many philosophers think they are, we should be in a position to know lottery propositions. In this paper I show that without denying that knowledge claims are closed under deduction, the tension between (a) and (c) can be resolved by using non-monotonic logic and by appealing to what I call “cognitive bracketing.”</p>

		                	<p class="description">Can a criminal defendant be convicted on statistical evidence if his probability of guilt is sufficiently high? A rich literature developed on this question over the years, yet many thought that it would be of limited practical interest because the possibility that a defendant be incriminated on statistical evidence alone seemed to be far-fetched. Things have changed, however. DNA evidence, a powerful form of statistical evidence, is now a common presence in the courtroom, and some defendants have been recently convicted on only DNA evidence. Unsurprisingly, this has revived interest in the question of whether a conviction is acceptable on statistical evidence alone.</p>

		                    <p class="description">My topic is a comparison between statistical and traditional evidence in Anglo-American criminal trials. Prompted by studies showing that traditional forms of evidence, such as testimonies and fingerprints, are highly subjective and unreliable, legal scholars have explored ways to counter this problem, e.g. by adopting more demanding standards of admissibility or rules of weight. I will suggest that it is difficult to restrict the role of traditional forms of evidence in criminal trials without creating further complications. I will also discuss some of the dangers that statistical evidence poses for criminal justice.</p>
